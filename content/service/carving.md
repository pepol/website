I carve wooden utensils (spoons, butter knives, bowls, ladles), serving trays,
but also different figures (horses, owls, forest spirits) and anything else
I can come up with.

<!--more-->
I mostly use birch, maple, and cherry wood as material.

My carving process is more thoroughly described in my different blog posts,
which also shows my tools and how I use them.

The tools I use are the following:

 - Gransfors Bruks Carpenter's Axe
 - Pfeil Small Curved Adze
 - Morakniv 220 Wood Splitting Knife
 - Morakniv 106 Wood Carving Knife
 - Morakniv 163 Hook Knife
 - Morakniv 164 Hook Knife

You can ready more about how I keep my tools sharp in the [sharpening](/service/sharpening)
section.
