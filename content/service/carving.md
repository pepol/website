I regularly carve wooden utensils, such as eating spoons, serving spoons,
wooden bowls, and trays for serving food on.

<!--more-->
I mostly use birch, maple, and cherry wood as material.

My carving process is more thoroughly described in my different blog posts,
which also shows my tools and how I use them.

The tools I use are the following:

 - Gransfors Bruks Carpenter's Axe
 - Pfeil Small Curved Adze
 - Morakniv 220 Wood Splitting Knife
 - Morakniv 106 Wood Carving Knife
 - Morakniv 163 Hook Knife
 - Morakniv 164 Hook Knife

You can ready more about how I keep my tools sharp in the [sharpening](service/sharpening/)
section.
