Due to woodworking requiring very sharp blades, I had to perfect my sharpening
skills. Thanks to this, I can offer to sharpen any tool that has a sharp edge.

<!--more-->

To sharpen the tools, I use a combined grinding and honing system TIGER 2500
made by German company Scheppach. Other tools that I use to sharpen provided
edges are Japanese waterstones, the King variety, and custom-made leather
honing strop, with chromium oxide honing compound.

I'm able to sharpen following tools:

 - Kitchen knives
 - Other knives (pocket, camping, work, carving)
 - Chisels
 - Plane blades
 - Gouges
 - Axes & adzes
 - Scissors
 - Straight razors

In case you're interested in availing of my services, or if you have another
a tool other than the ones listed, please contact me for my availability and
further instructions.
