I am able to build small boats (kayaks, canoes, little sailboats) from
wood. These boats are built primarily from pine, oak, and black locust
and in style of Viking boats (such as Oselvar boats and Faerings).

I try to build the boats in traditional way, primarily using tools, such
as axes, adzes, chisels, and knives. I try to use riven wood, because
of its inherent strength.
