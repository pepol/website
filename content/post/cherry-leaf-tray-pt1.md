Over the last weekend, I got to go back to carving my Leaf Tray from Cherry
wood. This is a project that has been ongoing for some time, as I couldn't
find much time to do woodcarving.

I created the design back in October as a freehand drawing of leaf on the raw
cherry board, that I debarked before.

Once done, I decided to carve the bowl (inside) of the tray using Pfeil curved
adze. This proved very laborious, as the wood was dry, however I managed to
carve some of the wood out of the bowl.

I didn't manage to get back to carving the tray until Sunday, 26th January,
where I took out my curved gouge and carved out the rest of the bowl.

It had a heavy toil on my wrist, however I was lucky and didn't get any bruises
from the gouge. And the bowl was complete.

And so came this weekend. On Saturday, after we finished the house chores, I
went ahead and started carving the outside. At first, I wanted to use a hacksaw
and cut out the outline from the plank, needing only to use a knife afterwards.

However hacksawing without a proper workbench to hold the plank proved very
difficult, so I instead opted for an approach similar to carving with green
wood. I created a couple of stop-cuts across the grain, in similar fashion
as when making spoons out of green wood. However, instead of opting for axe to
take out the material, I decided to be frendlier to neighbours (we live in a
flat and I don't have a dedicated workbench - more on that in another post)
and I used my Mora 220, pushing it into the plank, while twisting the handles
slightly. Since the wood was dry, it split very easily, with large chunks of
wood literally flying off the smaller and smaller plak (or blank, since it now
started to resemble the final tray).

And that's all I managed to do on the tray so far. When I manage to find some
time for carving again, I plan to continue carving the sides, still with Mora
220, but also with my normal carving knife - Mora 106, to shape the outside of
the tray.
