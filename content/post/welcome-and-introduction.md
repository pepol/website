Hello, I'd like to welcome you to my journal.

My name is Peter and I live in Slovakia, working in IT field, as freelance
consultant. I'm currently busy with a Site Reliability Engineering project.
My background is in Software Engineering and Computer Science, which I studied
at Comenius University in Bratislava.

In recent years, I've found passion in all things related to wood working.
This happened mostly through my passion of sailing and boating, as I was
introduced into boat maintenance, repairs and so onto boat building. From all
the available materials, wood was the easiest (and nicest!) to get to.

From then on, I tried my hands at carpentry and timber framing. While carpentry
didn't interest me much, I was fascinated with traditional timber framing,
especially the use of axes, which for me was always a crude tool for splitting
firewoord. However, here I learned that axe can be used for making beautiful
and functional stuff very easily.

After finding traditional timber framing fascinating, I wanted to incorporate
it into my boatbuilding use. That's where I found traditional methods of boat
building, especially the Nordic methods explored and employed by the Viking
Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. These traditions, which are still used for
building strong, sea-worthy boats, such as the Oselvar Faering, immediately
struck my heart, which caused me to long for a beautiful small-ish wooden boat
in the viking/faering style. This is currently an ongoing project of mine in
**planning** stage.

As I was exploring the viking and Nordic traditions related to wood working,
I discovered a set of teachings from Sweden, called Sloyd. As I currently don't
have a big enough workshop to build the faering-type boat, Sloyd resonated with
me as a discipline and project inspiration for working with wood in the
meantime...

And that's how I got here, today, carving wooden spoons, butter knives,
spatulas, trays, and bowls from different species of wood, always trying to
start with green wood, using the most efficient tools for the job and finishing
with a beautiful, hand-made product, without the use of electric tools at all.

Hope you enjoy my products and lessons learned.
